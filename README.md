## 🧾 Project Overview

This project forecasts sales across multiple retail outlets using Machine Learning and Deep Learning. It helps businesses plan better using future sales predictions and key trend insights.

🎯 **Goal**:  
To build a predictive model and interactive dashboard for future retail sales planning.

🛠️ **Workflow**:  
Data Preprocessing ➜ Machine Learning ➜ Deep Learning (LSTM) ➜ Streamlit App

---

## 🔹 Step 1:  
### 🧹 Data Preprocessing & EDA (`Task 1.ipynb`)

- 🧽 Cleaned missing values, checked consistency  
- 📈 Performed EDA to identify patterns in sales  
- 📊 Explored features like `DayOfWeek`, `Promo`, and `StateHoliday`

---

## 🔹 Step 2:  
### 🤖 Machine Learning Model (`Task 2-2.5 ML.ipynb`)

- 🧠 Trained multiple regression models  
- 📉 Evaluated using RMSE & MAE  
- 🔍 Identified most important features driving sales  

---

## 🔹 Step 3:  
### 🧠 Deep Learning with LSTM (`Task 2.6 DL.ipynb`)

- ⏳ Used LSTM neural network to capture time-based patterns  
- ⚡ Achieved enhanced performance over ML models  

---

## 🔹 Step 4:  
### 📲 Streamlit App Deployment (`Task 2.7-3.py`)

- 🖥️ Built interactive dashboard with input file support  
- 📆 Predicts future sales and shows trend graphs  
- 💾 Exports predictions as downloadable CSV
