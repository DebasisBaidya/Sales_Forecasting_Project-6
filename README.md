This project predicts sales trends using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models, designed to assist businesses in planning and decision-making. The final solution is deployed as an interactive Streamlit dashboard for easy accessibility.

## Project Overview
The project follows a structured workflow involving data preprocessing, machine learning modeling, deep learning implementation, and dashboard deployment. Each phase is outlined below:

## Step 1: Data Preprocessing & EDA (`Task 1.ipynb`)
In this step:
- The dataset was cleaned by handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to uncover patterns, trends, and insights crucial for model training.
- Key features such as `DayOfWeek`, `Promo`, and `StateHoliday` were analyzed to assess their impact on sales.

## Step 2: Machine Learning Model (`Task 2-2.5 ML.ipynb`)
- Various regression models were explored to predict sales based on features like store details, promotions, and holidays.
- The best-performing model was selected based on evaluation metrics such as RMSE and MAE.
- Feature importance analysis provided insights into the most influential variables.

## Step 3: Deep Learning Model (`Task 2.6 DL.ipynb`)
- An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network was developed to enhance prediction accuracy by capturing temporal dependencies in the sales data.

## Step 4: Streamlit Deployment (`task 2.7-3.py`)
- The trained LSTM model was integrated into a Streamlit dashboard for seamless user interaction.
- Users can upload CSV or Excel files with necessary data fields, receive instant predictions, and visualize results.
- The dashboard includes interactive graphs for predicted sales trends and a feature importance visualization (generated using random values as a placeholder).

## Features
âœ… Simple interface for easy use, Excel or CSV File upload i.e. Test Data
âœ… Uploaded Data Preview
âœ… Displays the last available date with Uploaded File Name from uploaded data for better context
âœ… Predicts sales for the next 6 weeks
âœ… CSV download option for predicted results

## How to Use
1. Upload a CSV/Excel file with the required columns: `Id`, `Store`, `DayOfWeek`, `Open`, `Promo`, `StateHoliday`, `SchoolHoliday`, `Date`.
2. View predicted sales trends in both tabular and graphical formats.
3. Download the results as a CSV file if needed.

Effortlessly predict future sales trends with interactive visualizations and detailed insights. ðŸš€
